# Best way to name note files

I believe the best way to name note files is to have the creation date followed by the title.

Since we are dealing with plain text this makes the filename to be a context of when the file was created. I've encountered several times files online where there was no creation date, this is the same as encountering a blog post without a date, you have no idea when that was written!

I think this system is the best and it helped be to migrate from one note taking system to another.

I am yet to find a good way with tiddlywiki, but I have some ideas: [](#Idea%20to%20export%20tiddlywiki%20markdown)
