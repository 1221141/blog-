# Need to find a way to make tiddlers in markdown deployable in gh-pages

My previous workflow made it possible to deploy my notes in gh-pages, I have a complex github actions workflow that makes it possible to have a repo only with notes and at every commit trigger another repository to pull the changes and build into gh-pages website.

Initially I've been using the gh-pages default workflow, but I tried briefly writing a static webpage  made with sveltekit and some markdown library.

I need to find a way sync the markdown I had with the new tiddlywiki.
