# First Entry

Hi.

I decided to start writing a blog. Noone is supposed to read this, but I guess
I will eventually leave it public, no harm in that.

For the past few months I've been interested in several different things, and
it has been really hard to keep it track of all the things that I find/do, I
think it might help if I start logging all sort of stuff, specially to keep
things *off my head*.

One of these things is exactly about note taking, I've been thinkering with
different note-taking apps and frameworks, and I think I can come up with some
structure for a blog.

The blog will be plain text files (markdown) and I will write some code to wrap
the contents in some server html files.

I guess that is it for this entry, in the next ones I will talk about the new
camera that I got.

See ya.
