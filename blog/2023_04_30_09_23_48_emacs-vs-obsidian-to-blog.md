# Emacs vs Obsidian to blog

I spent considerable amount of time yesterday trying to configure Obsidian to work the same way as my emacs blog-mode.

There is a major advantage when using emacs, all the configuration is in a single programmable file, while in Obsidian to achieve the same configuration I had to install 4 different plugins and configure them in a GUI. (Although those configurations are saved in a `configuration.json` file and easily restored in case of a new update (unless there is a code change)).

I don't regret it, I think it was a great experience and it works nice when I am using my Windows machine, but when in my Chromebook or my dell with Linux the emacs might be a better alternative.
